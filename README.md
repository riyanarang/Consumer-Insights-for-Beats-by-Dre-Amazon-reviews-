This project aims to gain deeper insights into customer experiences and sentiments regarding Beats earbuds. Customer reviews for 10 different earbud brands were gathered from Amazon through data mining, with Python in Google Colab and Oxylabs used for data collection. After data cleaning and processing, patterns and trends in the data were analyzed using statistical tools and visualizations. Later, sentiment analysis was conducted using artificial intelligence techniques to uncover key insights, focusing on customer preferences and pain points.
